# HsModelisation

## About

This project contains different solid 3D CAD models I created and their progression.

I use [ImplicitCAD](https://github.com/colah/ImplicitCAD) and [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
Maybe [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) in the future.

## Goals

- Learn Haskell, as it is my first experience with this language.
- Prototype and create 3D CAD (in .stl file format) I then slice in order to 3D print them.
